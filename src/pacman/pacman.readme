Classic video game - press key "5" to insert a coin, press key "1" to start the game, move Pacman with cursor keys, press key "Esc" to quit pacman. If you want to cheat, you first have to load pacman (i.e. type "pacman" in the shell), leave pacman (using "Esc"), enter the cheat poke (i.e. "poke 2528 7" -> bit 0: skip level with key "n", 1: no collision detection, 2: infinite lives) and restart pacman using the command "sys 2512".
